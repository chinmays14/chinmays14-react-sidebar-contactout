# Your challenge/task

- [ ] Build the Sidebar nav and Account Settings popover with the menu
- [ ] Clicking `Lists` should update the URL to `/lists` and just show a blank page with the text "this is the lists page".
- [ ] Clicking `Search` should update the URL to `/search` and just show a blank page with the text "this is the search page"
- [ ] Clicking the avatar should show the menu
- [ ] Clicking `Account` should highlight the `Account` with underline and arrow
- [ ] Show the `account-submenu` when `Account` is active
- [ ] Clicking away should reset state and hide the popover
- [ ] Clicking the other menu items `Your Exports`, `Integrations`, `Log out` do nothing (or something, that'll be up to you)
